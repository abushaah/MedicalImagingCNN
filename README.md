### Abstract

**About**

Using convolutional neural networks (ML) for classifying medical images.

**What does the software do?**

Analyze, detect, and diagnose chest x ray, mammogram, brain tumours, etc. depending on dataset

**How?**

Convolutional neural network model trained on existing positive and negative healthcare cases datasets

**Purpose**

1. Doctors:
    - Prioritize scans on a daily basis for viewing by doctor
    - Prioritize scans based on medical history of patient and result
2. Patients:
    - Faster results

### Validation

1. Use an AI model evaluation (with a focus on healthcare): [epic-open-source/seismometer](https://github.com/epic-open-source/seismometer)
2. Consult in industry experts for their opinions

### Software tools
- Monai
- Pytorch
